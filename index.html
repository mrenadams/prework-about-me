      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an Editor for an online healthcare publication called <a href="mendwell.com">MendWell</a></p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from Orange County, CA, but I came to San Diego (UCSD) for college and I never wanted to leave! </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to hang out with my puppy, Coco and go on walking adventures. I also love to cook and try my hand at gardening... green thumb pending. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My true dream job is to be a florist... but working in media pays the bills.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Solana Beach, CA.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I run a website as the core part of my job. To be able to make all of the updates and changes myself would be a game changer, and I know it would help me for years to come. </p>
